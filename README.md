Compared to their linear counterparts, cyclic peptides - especially those â‰¤ 6 residues in length - exhibit superior metabolic stability, conformational rigidity, and receptor binding specificity, making them promising scaffolds for therapeutic development. However, predicting the cyclization yield of short peptides remains challenging due to the energy needed to achieve the preorganized cyclic geometry and the competing tendency for oligomerization. In this study, we present a machine learning framework designed to predict the cyclization propensities of short peptides using features derived from conformational ensembles. We used force field mechanics to perform conformational searches and generate low-energy structural ensembles for each peptide. From these ensembles, we extracted key geometric and electronic descriptors, including backbone dihedral angles, hydrogen-bonding distances, and side-chain features. To account for thermodynamic contributions, we applied Boltzmann weighting to generate ensemble-averaged inputs for regression models. We trained multiple linear regression, random forest, and support vector regression models to predict cyclization yield, finding that Boltzmann-weighted side-chain descriptors significantly improved prediction performance. This approach offers a robust method for forecasting cyclization outcomes and facilitates the design of cyclic peptides with therapeutic potential.
